# rhythmspace-demo
Here we have a working prototype of a rhythm space based on Puredata and python via the py object.
This prototype inputs a precomputed rhythm space resulting from an experiment with subjects assesing rhythm similarity.
The space contains nine EDM drum patterns which are spread around the space following the distance measures of the subjects.
This Rhythm Space can interpolate between the nodes thus creating new hybrid rhythm patterns thus expanding the contents 
of the collection and allowing for new rhthms to emerge. The discrete space is converted into a continous space.
